I was asked by [Unico][unico-link] to help put a pitch together for Sony as they were busy doing other stuff. I only had a couple of days to come up with the concept and put pitch material together for it, so rather than detail, I went for impact and created a pitch in the style of a treasure map. We didn't get the budget but I was told that it did have 'impact'. I had a lot of fun making this. I did the graphic design and presentation of the map, as well as writing the concept, and [Masahiko Murakami][maa-link] did the two illustrations of the pirates and the Vita-boat.
