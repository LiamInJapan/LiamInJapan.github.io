An original concept by [Hawken King][hawken-link], [Isgard][isgard-link] a kind of 2d Mechwarrior: Merenaries meets Counter Strike style team-on-team competitive blaster. I jumped in on this and worked a little on controls and network. It soon became apparent it was way too ambitious to tackle with 2 people. It's a great concept though and I'd be very happy to work on this again if funding ever came up.
