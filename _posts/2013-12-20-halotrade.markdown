I was brought on to this [Barclays funded project][barclays-link] do both some programming (Obj-C, Python, Go) as well as some consulting on the whole project. [Halotrade][halotrade-link] uses the combined power of blockchain technology and invoice financing to transform supply chain practices. Halotrade's shared ledger technology links the supply chain from end to end: from certifications of farms and factories to tracking shipments around the world until delivery. It help's participating suppliers in developing markets access financing terms from global banks.
