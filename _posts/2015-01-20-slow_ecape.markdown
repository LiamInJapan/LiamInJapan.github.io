[Slow Escape][slow-escape-link] was created in conjunction with Pauline Machabert and Tom Hart as part of a Global Game Jam. I worked on it for a few weeks after too before things got too busy with other projects. However I definitely think there is a fun game in here (and also one with scope that could be carried out by only a couple of people) and hope to revisit it in the not too distant future.
