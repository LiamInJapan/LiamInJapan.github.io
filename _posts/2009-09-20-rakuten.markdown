I worked at [Rakuten][rakuten-link] full time for a year, where I laid down build processes for the department. Working with Jenkins, Testflight and lots of bits and bobs of shell script and other tools, I built and automated processes to allow for the creation and distribution of potentially dozens of apps. I also did some work on the remake of the [Rakuten Ichiba][rakuten-ichiba-app] app as well as various libraries and apps for the department.
