        <title>Kanji Wars</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kanji Wars is a personal project to help anyone study Japanese in a fun and amusing way. Art is provided by the very talented &lt;a href=&quot;http://beresnev.design/&quot;&gt;Oleg Beresnev&lt;/a&gt;. Development has started recently, and we hope to release an early version to teach Hiragana and Katakana within a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AgriPlay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A project to try and encourage people to get into farming through fun gameplay mechanics. Sensors pull data from the soil, and generate events for groups to tackle. Like Farmville but with real farming activities instead of endless clicking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art provided by the very talented &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawkenking.com/&quot;&gt;Hawken King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Slow Escape</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/slow-escape&quot;&gt;Slow Escape&lt;/a&gt; was created in conjunction with Pauline Machabert and Tom Hart as part of a Global Game Jam. I worked on it for a few weeks after too before things got too busy with other projects. However I definitely think there is a fun game in here (and also one with scope that could be carried out by only a couple of people) and hope to revisit it in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pro Zombie Soccer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I ported &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prozombiesoccer.com/&quot;&gt;PZS&lt;/a&gt; from iOS to Playstation Mobile. The libaries we’re pretty awful to use, take-up by the community for it weak, and the conditions of my contract terrible. This never saw the light of day unfortunately, and I ended up working close to 1000 hours unpaid. A harsh lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Isgard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;An original concept by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawkenking.com/&quot;&gt;Hawken King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playisgard.com/&quot;&gt;Isgard&lt;/a&gt; a kind of 2d Mechwarrior: Merenaries meets Counter Strike style team-on-team competitive blaster. I jumped in on this and worked a little on controls and network. It soon became apparent it was way too ambitious to tackle with 2 people. It’s a great concept though and I’d be very happy to work on this again if funding ever came up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Virius</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Virius was an original concept I worked on for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vitei.com/&quot;&gt;Vitei Backroom&lt;/a&gt;. They decided not to continue the concept, but I plan to spend some of my own time in the future revisiting this.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sony and Nintendo Pitches</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was asked by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unico-inc.jp&quot;&gt;Unico&lt;/a&gt; to help put a pitch together for Sony as they were busy doing other stuff. I only had a couple of days to come up with the concept and put pitch material together for it, so rather than detail, I went for impact and created a pitch in the style of a treasure map. We didn’t get the budget but I was told that it did have ‘impact’. I had a lot of fun making this. I did the graphic design and presentation of the map, as well as writing the concept, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://maamite.com&quot;&gt;Masahiko Murakami&lt;/a&gt; did the two illustrations of the pirates and the Vita-boat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Listen and Repeat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I did some contract work for &lt;a href=&quot;http://tacchistudios.com/&quot;&gt;Tacchi Studios&lt;/a&gt; on this app to teach business English learners correct pronunciation via a voice interface.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rakuten</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I worked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rakuten.co.jp/&quot;&gt;Rakuten&lt;/a&gt; full time for a year, where I laid down build processes for the department. Working with Jenkins, Testflight and lots of bits and bobs of shell script and other tools, I built and automated processes to allow for the creation and distribution of potentially dozens of apps. I also did some work on the remake of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/rakuten-shopping/id762167763?mt=8&quot;&gt;Rakuten Ichiba&lt;/a&gt; app as well as various libraries and apps for the department.&lt;/p&gt;
