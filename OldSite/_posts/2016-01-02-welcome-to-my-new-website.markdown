My new years resolution is to try and blog more about programming and software development, and with that in mind I have set up this Jekyll powered Github pages blog (and you can too by [visiting][tut1] [these][tut2] [pages][tut3]).

I will be blogging again in a few days about my new portfolio page. It is still in development but current progress can be found [here][portfolio].
It is currently only tested on Mac OS X and Chrome. I'd be very suprised if it works on mobile at all.

Happy 2016 and may all your dreams and goals for this year come true!
