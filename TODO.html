Minimum Viable Portfolio

tldr; I am creating a new data driven portfolio in the vein of an RPG character sheet. 
It can be seen at liaminjapan.github.io/charSheet.html
It runs off a database and has a simple (command line) interface for updating skills and projects to see "character development" over time.

This is nowhere near complete. But as they say, if you are not embarrased by your first release, then you've released too late. :)
It is currently only tested in Chrome on Mac OS X. It almost certainly doesn't work on phones yet.

the longer version; Hello and welcome to my first proper post of this new blog! Today I will be introcucing something I am working on at the moment, a new portfolio. As a freelancer, a portfolio provides 

With that in mind, here are the desired outcomes of this project:

- Present completed projects and a profile of my skillset

- Present them in a format that represents the skills in itself

I could create a much simpler (and probably better look, at least at first) portfolio using something like Wordpress and a good looking theme. However, doing it in the format that I have chosen feels more respresentative of my background as a hybrid game designer/software engineer. It might take a little more time, but I feel this will be worth it.

- Learn some new skills

Skills used: Parse, Javascript (underscore.js, paper.js, Parse API), HTML, CSS, Python

While in theory I know how a web application is put together, I am yet to touch all parts of a whole web application. Truth be told, web development is a massive gaping hole in my knowledge portfolio; other than a couple of simple Wordpress theme blogs I've never even put a web page together before. While this project can hardly be described as "full stack" (http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/) (I am not touching the operating system level code, and as I am using Parse, I am not thinking too deeply about the Database level), it does represent a fairly comprehensive exercise in developing a full web application.

Luckily it turns out its not that massively different from a native mobile application. :)


- Gamified CPD (Continued Professional Development)
As a professional software engineer (http://www.engc.org.uk/ukspec.aspx) and aspiring Chartered Engineer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Engineer_(UK)) I aim to engage in Continued Professional Development (e.g. to always be updating my knowledge portfolio). As was once said by Mary Poppins “In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun and 'snap', the job's a game.”; my attempt at finding the game in this is to create a skill sheet that I can level up. If I can be compelled to grind to gain levels in an RPG, perhaps I can use some of these motivational tricks to "grind" at real-life skills.


Potential Uses

- Personal and Team Development

As mentioned, this software can be used to track personal development, and help one and others understand an individuals skillset quickly. Goals could be set with this software, and team structures could be implemented. It could be integrated with a companies professional development and goal setting processes

- Hiring

Hiring is difficult and expensive. You need to generate a number of appropriate candidates (through advertising, recruiters or personal networks), you need to weed out unsuitable candidates and hone in on the potentially strong ones. Wouldn't it be great if you could generate a data-based profile and ask an API for a set of potential candidates rather than having to go through the traditional recruitment channels? Wouldn't it be great by the simple process of a candidate having set up such a profile that they are exhibiting some base programming knowledge such as the use of a command line tool and interacting with a REST API (arguably indispensable skills to any professional programmer worth his salt)? And finally wouldn't it be great to cut out that inevitable stage in an interview whereby the interviewer goes through the candidates set of skills and previous jobs and tries to glean that information from the candidate? A system like this could definitely optimise hiring processes.

Of course, the figures that are put into the system are self evaluated, and that can be lied about. But this is no different from a regular resume (and arguably, given the depth and contextuality of this system, it'd be harder to do so).

Limitations

- Accuracy of initial audit and ongoing data collection/honesty and integrity of data

The results that the system shows are only as honest as the data that is input into the system. However this is also true of the traditional resume, and this format at least provides the ability to do some basic data processessing to do some sanity checks. While I was very concientious of tracking time in projects when I first started 


- Some skills belong in multiple categories. Some skills are arguably just subets of other categories and other opinionated 

This is true. How do I make a a distinction for example between Objective C, UIKit and Interface Builder? The simple fact is, for every classification of skill, there is an array of opinions on why it could be something different. I get that.

- A man is not his numbers.

This is also true. Just because someone spends a long time doing something doesn't mean they are neccesarily good at it. I've spent a fair bit of time skateboarding, but it's a skill that seems to
